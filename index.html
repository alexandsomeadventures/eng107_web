    <p>Different animations have taken over the world with their unique perspectives and goals they aim to teach us, humans.
        However, there has been nothing like “Chainsaw man” in history of the anime. A story talking about a boy 
        who desires female attention but who is also considered as one of the strongest devil hunters follows incredible 
        adventures that are extremely relatable to  young generation. The topics include sexuality, violence, immaturity, 
        and surprising plot twists. The reason Chainsaw man rapidly became popular in society is its accuracy to behavior of 
        many teenagers in the world. As stated before, it is extremely relatable, describing things as attention, depression, 
        loneliness, craziness, quick decisions, regrets, suffering, parties, making it appealing to the young audience. Chainsaw
        man is currently rated 8.4/10 on IMDb and 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. Not to mention, it only has 1 season yet, which 
        shows how insanely good the show is compared to Attack on Titan, which has 9.1/10 on IMDb and 95% on Rotten 
        Tomates with its 4 seasons. Chainsaw man has potential to outscore every other animation in history of shows and 
        obtain the highest rating on platforms , as IMDb, in near future. Besides, the cause for its popularity can also be found 
        in choice of its music, unique art style, relatability, and insane plot twists.
        <h2>History of Chainsaw Man</h2>
        <br>Chainsaw man was released on October 12, 2022. It is a science fiction, action series.
        The manga is written by Tatsuki Fujimoto, who is very  mysterious person as he has almost never shown his face 
       publicly. The animation was produced by well-known studio, who made Attack on Titan as well, MAPPA. The story, 
       as said earlier, follows a boy who has inherited debt from his father and now has to pay incredible amount of money
       to lenders. However, once, he meets Pochita, a dog-shaped creature but in reality one of the strongest devils and 
       chainsaw devil, in injured state and attempts to help, which results in friendship between them. In short, the world of Chainsaw man is split in 
       2 groups : humans and devils. Devils are created through fear of humans( that is, the more people fear , say, spiders, 
       Spider Devil becomes stronger). There is a group of humans called devil hunters that fights devils on daily basis. 
       Nonetheless, there are some devils who help humans fight others, yet contract must be made. Contract is a deal
       between devil and human to lend each other something of their own( for example, contract with Spider Devil allows 
       one to use abilities of Spider Devil. In turn, humans must sacrifice something for contract to be made , such as their
       eyes, hair, ⅓ of their lifespan, hands, arms, and etc.). The amazing thing is (spoiler) Denji immediately dies at the 
       start of the series from lenders, yet Pochita, remembering Denji’s help, offers him a contract, which is usually awful 
       for humans since they must sacrifice something essential, that costs nothing. Thus, Denji’s Heart, which doesn’t 
       function anymore, gets mixed with Pochita’s body. This essentially means that pochita is now part of Denji’s body.
       Consequently, Denji becomes hybrid human with Pochita being his heart, therefore calling himself - Chainsaw Man.

        <h2>Music taste of the anime</h2>
    <p>Besides interesting storyline, the music chosen for Chainsaw Man is quite an astonishing selection. While in Attack
            on Titan, for instance, almost all the openings and themes throughout the show are mainly about being patriotic, or 
            Jojo’s Bizarre Adventures, which have compositions that often suit genre of adventures, Chainsaw Man ranges from
            rock-n-roll, sad, and positive to melodic songs. It pretty much contains all the genres of music that are listened today
            by the young. For instance, ending of episode 12 features song called <a href="https://youtu.be/7jM0fUAR2xg?si=6C2mtZThrumA_apV">“Fight Song” by Eve</a>, which sound depressive
            and at the same has glimpses of hope, despair, and optimism. It tries to show good time that there were before and that
            now everything has changed. Another one, opening of the anime, called <a href="https://youtu.be/dFlDRhvM4L0?si=1w2MwkbA5Bs83z_H">“Kick Back” by Kenshi Yonezu</a> demonstrates 
            completely another music style compared to previously mentioned song. It is a blend of rock, pop, and electronica,
             with elements of alternative rock, hip hop, and jazz. This song, fortunately, is optimistic enough and perfect for the 
            anime as it basically describes the mood of the plot during the whole season. It contains various crazy sound (in first
            few lines for example). The reason this opening is so “crazy” and dynamic in sound is because it perfectly captures
            how crazy the manga writer, Fujimoto is (in good terms). As stated earlier, Chainsaw man has plot twists which can 
            never be expected by the audience ( for example, main or secondary main character suddenly dies. A person , of 
            course, might feel shocked, yet it is completely normal thing in the anime). The anime also features surprising cameos
            by different characters. Usually, in other animations, one might see comeo/ reunion of old friends, or some characters 
            who were considered to be dead. Consequently, spectator feels satisfaction. However, in Chainsaw Man, cameos are
            different. There might be sudden friendship or reunion during the battle between protagonists and antagonists, which
            one would not predict in common animations. Another song, ending of episode 3, published by <a href="https://youtu.be/HEwAiwttN10?si=ryrifC74LAeVSu2A"> MAPPA studio
                on Youtube</a>, performs quite different style of music. The genre is rock-n-roll, yet even in such case, one would
probably think right now that the composition might be similar to other rock-n-roll songs. It is simply not. The song
differs from rock-n-roll pieces as Smells like teen spirit by Nirvana, or Rumbling by Sim, in the fact that it, again,
contains elements of surprise. For instance, after a few seconds of listening, one might hear sudden voice quickly 
singing lyrics, which might be thought of as rap. This continues for following few more seconds and then it abruptly
changes to quiet and calm music indicating plot changes written in the manga. Chainsaw man is quite popular for its
music selection  as its openings, endings , and other in-series themes are played by many great Youtube musicians,
 such as  Animenz, or Fonzi . Therefore, for instance, previously mentioned ‘Kick Back’ by Kenshi Yonezu achieved
<a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2023/10/25/chainsaw-man-opening-kick-back-achieves-first-ever-japanese-language-riaa-gold-certification">certified gold record award by RIAA</a>.
<h2>Unique art style</h2> 
<br>As can be seen with previously shown pictures, animation style of the series could be believed as “typical one”. 
On the other hand, the manga itself is quite different. If you have read any other manga before, then you are probably
aware that some of the authors are trying too hard to show their unique art styles; some of them are even 
overcomplicating things. Fujimoto keeps it not only simple but also “intuitive”. It feels more humane:
    </p>
        <img  src="img/spoiler1.png"     alt = 'Denji fights Makima' title="Fighting Makima(Chapters 95-97)" width="412" height="650" loading="lazy">

        <p>Chapters 95-97. Images by Tatsuki Fujimoto
            <br>If you notice, the drawing is similar to that of American comics(such as Marvel):
        </p>
        <img  src="img/marvel.png"     alt = 'Marvel Comics comparison art style' title="Western art style" width="768" height="432" loading="lazy">
        <p>Therefore, Fujimoto was able to conquer not only local audience but also Western one. His art style, being simple in
            design as Macbook or Iphone by Apple, can be interpreted easily by teenagers. It doesn’t require “reading between 
            the lines” or careful eye for seeing any details. This might be seen at the same time as disadvantage for people who 
            love Easter eggs, yet such art style doesn’t need any. Jojo’s Bizzare Adventures, for instance, was written by Araki 
            Hirohiko, whose art style is not rated positively by majority since not everybody likes muscular men:
        </p>
        <img  src="img/jojo1.png"     alt = 'Jonathan Joestar' title="Jojo pictures" width="186" height="271" loading="lazy">
        <img  src="img/jojo2.png"     alt = 'Jolyne Kujo' title="Jojo pictures" width="300" height="168" loading="lazy">
        <img  src="img/jojo3.png"     alt = 'Dio' title="Jojo pictures" width="217" height="232" loading="lazy">
        <p>Images 1,3 by Araki Hirohiko. Image 2 by Mappa Studio</p>
        <p><br>Jojo series is famous for its “muscular” art style. This can be alarming for some as it can be stated that this is a way
            to “sexualize” characters, ultimately leading to debatable conversations. Meanwhile, Attack on Titan’s, written by
            Hajime Isayama, art style looks more historic and dark. One piece, one of the most famous anime by Eiichiro Oda,
             has miniature( i.e. many details can be put in 1 panel making it confusing sometimes) art style:
        </p>
        <img  src="img/aot.png.jpg"     alt = 'Attack on Titan' title="Attack on titan art style" width="554" height="364" loading="lazy">

        <img  src="img/op.png.jpg"     alt = 'One piece' title="One piece art style" width="600" height="444" loading="lazy">
        <p>One piece. Image by Eiichiro Oda</p>
        <p>Tatsuki Fujimoto art’s style is indeed appealing and plot could be understood by people with different viewpoints;
            The art style and plot development combine into a peculiar book that is called “Chainsaw Man”.
            <h2> Being Relatable and Unpredictable</h2>
              <br> As was stated previously, changes in plot sometimes are quite unexpected, and this is probably the main reason
            for popularity of Chainsaw Man. Additionally, some of the events can be relatable on many different levels. For 
            example whereas Jojo’s Bizarre Adventures show fights on almost every other episode, or Attack on Titan that
            demonstrates determination to take revenge, Chainsaw Man talks about financial problems(such as being in debt), 
            being alone, needing support, desiring for attention, making deals, and learning from mistakes. The amazing fact is
             the show’s genre is fiction , yet it is able to talk about realistic issues, which occur in everyday life. Moreover, Denji,
             main character, has almost always lived in fear and stress; his goal is to live peacefully, normal life, without 
            bothering anyone and anyone bothering him. Most of people nowadays face same issue; they accumulate stress in
             schools, institutions, work, tasks, job positions, and even during vacations. They cannot simply relax since there is
             always some worrying thought that can be crucial and decisive for their lives. These problems combined with plot 
            story create surprise and high tension. For instance, main character dies instantly in first episode; almost all the 
            characters die by chapter 97; completely new story begins after chapter 97 as if nothing happened before; suddenly 
            out of nowhere somebody gets revived(this can be seen multiple times both when helping and attacking against main 
            protagonist); audience doesn’t know who has plot armor(protagonist or antagonist); more new characters suddenly 
            appear; somebody decides to immediately change contract; and explosions occur sometimes as if it is normal. 
            Tatsuki Fujimoto knows how to make fans happy/sad/angry/bored since he knows exactly when to make plot changes.
            He knows exactly when to kill somebody who is deeply connected with audience emotions to make fans cry; He
            knows exactly when to revive somebody to make people shocked/happy. His way of thinking is so complicated that
audience sometimes doesn’t even know anymore whether something is for good or bad. Of course, everything gets 
explained later with genius answers, thus surprising the world. <br> Some of the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13616990/reviews"> reviews from IMDb include:</a> <hr>(9/10) "It'll
 blow your mind with insane plot-twists and world-building. I wasn't a fan of the beginning of CSM 'cuz it seemed a
 bit ludicrous and it took me some time to understand this unique world."; <br>(10/10) "The first episode of Chainsaw
Man was an excellent pilot for the introduction of this long-awaited series, MAPPA did an excellent job (as always)
 and I am eager to see where the story will lead.";	<br>(10/10) "They did not disappoint. The animation is top tier. Its so
fluid and the way they combine that with the cinematography it just leaves you wanting more. Not to mention the
obvious. There's a decent amount of action in the first episode and they nailed the it perfectly."; and  many others. <hr>
Chainsaw man has obtained quite a lot of positive reviews for its storyline and accuracy to the contemporary world.
Its way of showing similarities with the real world and at the same time being unpredictable makes it lead the way
of innovation.
    </p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>     The anime can be boasted for various of its traits, but mainly it has unique connection with each 
        viewer. Especially, fans have no idea even when it seems they can intuitively guess the repercussions 
        The anime knows how to touch fans’ hearts; its simplicity helps audience feel better grasp of their events.
        Simultaneously, the music choice, covered by different eminent musicians from social platforms such as Youtube,
        supplements themes going in the series and describes enormous range of emotions, which can be applied to almost
        anybody.  The art style, mixed with all of the features, helps to refine the art piece completely, leading to fully
        created composition.
